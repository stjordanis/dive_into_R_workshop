#1
- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we'll look at an amazing feature of R - vectorization - and at the basics of loops and functions.
    Let's start with vectorization.
    
#2
- Class: text
  Output: Remember how there are really no scalars in R?
    This also means that operations usually thought of as being performed on scalars are performed on vector objects in R.
    These operations are called vectorized.
    
#3
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For example, please go ahead and define a vector v as the sequence of integers from -10 to 10.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('v <- -10:10')
  Hint: Just type v <- -10:10.
  
#4
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, typing <vector> + <number> will add <number> to every element of <vector>.
    Add 7 to every element of v now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = '-10:10 + 7')
  Hint: Just type v + 7.

#5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Nice right? Now create a vector v2 containing the numbers from 10 to -10.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('v2 <- 10:-10')
  Hint: Just type v2 <- 10:-10.

#6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Because of vectorization, you can now add up the vectors, which is equivalent to adding up their elements.
    Please add v and v2 now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'v + v2')
  Hint: Just type v + v2.  


#7
- Class: text
  Output: Vectorization has many uses. In many cases, it helps avoid expensive looping constructs.
    This may lead to large performance gains.

#12
- Class: text
  Output: With vectorization used simultaneously on several vectors, pay attention to the vectors' length.
    Unless you really know what you're doing and have a special purpose, all vectors involved should normally be of the same length.
    
#1
- Class: text
  Output: Now let's have a quick look at functions!

#2
- Class: text
  Output: Functions automatically return the value of the last line of code.
    This is how you would define a function that adds 1 to its input 

#3
- Class: text
  Output: f <- function(x) x + 1
  
#4
- Class: text
  Output: If you have several statements in the function body, you need curly braces as delimiters, like this  
    
#5
- Class: text
  Output: f <- function(x) {a = x + 1; b = a * 2; b}
  
#6
- Class: text
  Output: Functions in R often have default arguments. These are specified in the parameter list as follows

#7
- Class: text
  Output: f <- function(x  =255) {x + 1}  
  
#8
- Class: text
  Output: Functions do not necessarily have to be named. You can also create inline functions (closures).
    We'll see an example at the end of this chapter.

#9
- Class: text
  Output: Now let's quickly look at control structures in R. R has the usual if-else, as in

#10
- Class: text
  Output: if (1 == 2) {print("strange")} else {print("expected")}
  
#11
- Class: text
  Output: What's very useful in data wrangling is the ifelse function.
    ifelse is vectorized, which means you can use it on vectors, like columns of a data.frame.
    
#13
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As an example, this time we'll choose the very well-known iris dataset.
    Please take a look at the first rows in the dataset.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('head(iris)')
  Hint: Just type head(iris).
  
#14
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use ifelse to check which rows have a Sepal.Length greater than 6.9.
    The syntax is ifelse(<condition>, <true case>, <false case>). Use TRUE for <true case> and FALSE for <false case>.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('ifelse(iris$Sepal.Length>6.9,TRUE, FALSE)')
  Hint: Just type ifelse(iris$Sepal.Length>6.9,TRUE, FALSE).
  
#15
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As you see, you get back a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs.
    You can use this to filter the rows according to whether they fulfill the condition.
    Now, do the same thing as before but store the result in a variable longer_than.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('longer_than <- ifelse(iris$Sepal.Length>6.9,TRUE, FALSE)')
  Hint: Just type longer_than <- ifelse(iris$Sepal.Length>6.9,TRUE, FALSE).
  
#16
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now you can use subsetting to get all irises which have Sepal.Length > 6.9.
    How this works is you use longer_than as a vector of indices to index into the iris dataset.
    Rows that are TRUE will be returned, rows that are FALSE will be omitted.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('iris[longer_than,]')
  Hint: Just type iris[longer_than,].  
  
#17
- Class: text
  Output: Finally, let's address the last subject of this chapter - looping.
  
#18
- Class: text
  Output: R has the usual for loop, but it is not used as much as you might think.
    For one, whenever possible we normally want to use vectorization instead.
    And second, there is the apply family of functions that - well - applies a function to all elements in a container.
    
#19
- Class: text
  Output: This is how a basic for loop looks.
     
#20
- Class: text
  Output: for (i in 1:10) {print(i)}
  
#21
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use a for loop to print Petal.Length for the first 3 rows of the iris dataset.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('for (i in iris[1:3,"Petal.Length"]) {print(i)}', 'for(i in iris[1:3,3]) print(i)','for (i in 1:3) print(iris$Petal.Length[i])', 'for (i in iris[1:3,"Petal.Length"]) print(i)','for (i in iris[1:3,3]) {print(i)}')
  Hint: Just type for (i in iris[1:3,'Petal.Length']) {print(i)}.  
  
#22
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Compare this to how you would use vectorization to apply a transformation to that same subset of data.
    Again for the first 3 rows, add 1 to Petal.Length now (using vectorization).
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('iris[1:3,"Petal.Length"] + 1','iris[1:3, 3] + 1')
  Hint: Just type iris[1:3,'Petal.Length'] + 1.   
  
#23
- Class: text
  Output: Then, there's the apply family - apply, lapply, sapply, mapply...
  
#24
- Class: text
  Output: We'll just quickly look at apply and lapply/sapply here.
    If you later find yourself using apply & co. a lot, definitely check out purrr - a package by tidyverse creator Hadley Wickham that provides typesafe functional programming with R. 
    You use lapply to apply a function to every element of a vector, or list, and it returns the result as a list.
    For example, here we apply an inline function to a vector of characters
    
#25
- Class: text
  Output: lapply(letters[1:4], toupper)
    
#26
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just type lapply(letters[1:4], toupper) now to see how the result looks.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('lapply(letters[1:4], toupper)')
  Hint: Just type lapply(letters[1:4], toupper).   
    
#27
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As you see, even though the input was a vector, the result is a list. Sapply, on the other hand, simplifies the result.
    Type sapply(letters[1:4], toupper) now to see how the return value differs.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('sapply(letters[1:4], toupper)')
  Hint: Just type sapply(letters[1:4], toupper).   
  
#28
- Class: text
  Output: Finally, apply is used on 2- or n-dimensional objects, e.g., matrices.
    You apply a function to either the rows or the columns of a matrix. For example,
    
#29
- Class: text
  Output: apply(m, 1, sum)
  
#30
- Class: text
  Output: computes the sum of the rows of matrix m, whereas
  
#31
- Class: text
  Output: apply(m, 2, mean)

#32
- Class: text
  Output: computes the column means.
    
#33
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can also use this on a data.frame, or more precisely, its numeric columns. 
    Please create a matrix iris_matrix of the iris dataset, using the first 4 columns only.
    Use the as.matrix function for data type conversion, as in my_matrix <- as.matrix(my_frame).
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('iris_matrix <- as.matrix(iris[ ,1:4])','iris_matrix <- as.matrix(iris[1:4])')
  Hint: Just type iris_matrix <- as.matrix(iris[ ,1:4]).   
  
  
#34
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use apply to compute the column means of iris_matrix.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('apply(iris_matrix, 2, mean)')
  Hint: Just type apply(iris_matrix, 2, mean).     
  
#35
- Class: text
  Output: OK, that's it for now! It's time to jump into the tidyverse!
